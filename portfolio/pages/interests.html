    <h3 class="points">Cooking</h3>
    <p class="point-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely impossible to survive without eationg but that does not mean we should eat everything.
      That is one of the reason why I enjoy cooking. I often make sure that whatever I am cooking is healthy for me but also delicious.
    </p>

    <h3 class="points">Exercising</h3>
    <p class="point-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up, I have always been very active. I used to play soccer with my friends, climbing trees 
      to get some delicious fruits. it was very fun. Now that I am very aware of the benefits of exercising, I decided not to go two weeks without 
      working out.
    </p>
    <h3 class="points">Sports</h3>
    <p class="point-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports are something that everybody love in my family. With soccer being a popular 
      sport in my country, my all family ended up being fan of it. Back in my teenage years, I developed the love for boxing and it became my 
      favorite sport followed by soccer and basketball.
    </p>
    <h3 class="points">Reading &amp Trading</h3>
    <p class="point-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is power. This is something that I take very seriously. I may not know everything
      but I don't give excuses when it comes to learning something new. I have been ignorant of a lot of things growing up becasue I did not have 
      access to the necessary tool to further my knowledge. However since I came to the United States of America, I have learned a lot in few years
      that I spent here already. Due to my curiosity, I have discovered that you can also make a lot of money just by trading. I spent quiet some time 
      studying the market and I think it has a lot of potential.
